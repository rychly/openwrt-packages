Building options:

make cli
    Creates esmska-cli console application

make service
    Creates esmska-cli, esmskad daemon and libesmska.so library

make
    Same as 'make service'

The CC variable is available.

===================================================================

Feature options for esmskad:

There are 3 optional features to choose from while building
esmskad. To enable them, assign any of these separated by a space,
to the OPTIONS variable.

-D_SUPER_SERVER_DAEMON
    Transforms the classic daemon into one that can be under
    the management of a super-server daemon such as inetd
    or systemd.

-D_REQUEST_CHECK_SOURCE
    Enables request checking whether it's a valid HTTP request
    (containing "\r\n\r\n" to separate header and body). When these
    CRLF characters are not preceding the body, it will lead
    to service failure.

-D_CHECK_JSON
    Enables JSON checking in the request body whether it contains
    required attributes (GATEWAY, NUMBER, TEXT). If any of these
    is missing while this option is disabled, the running service
    process will fail.

Example:
    make service OPTIONS="-D_CHECK_JSON -D_SUPER_SERVER_DAEMON"

===================================================================

Installation instructions:

Type 'make install' to copy the built files into their respective
directories.

esmska-cli & esmskad ....... /usr/bin
libesmska.so.1.0.0 ......... /lib
libesmska.so.1 symlink ..... /lib

The installation process will create a directory in /usr/share
called esmska, where the user is supposed to put the JavaScript
gateway modules from the original esmska implementation
<https://code.google.com/p/esmska/>.

===================================================================

Uninstallation instructions:

Type 'make uninstall' to completely remove the library, all binaries
and the /usr/share/esmska directory along with its modules.
